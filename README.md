# Max Patches
I have been programming with Max since 2007. It was my first programming language, and I learned a ton from it. This is a living repo with most, if not all, of the Max patches I've made, starting since then and continuing to now (notably with my dissertation, which can be found [here](http://www.elistine.com/diss)).

Particularly of interest to me are generative sound and video systems, trans-modal mapping (sound to image, image to sound), unique interfaces and mapping schema, and novel types of sound synthesis (especially those that demonstrate complex behavior).
